        I'm currently a senior at UC Irvine studying Computer Science and Software Engineering. I am excited to announce that I will be joining the DC Console team this summer as a Front-End Engineer AWS Intern!
        In the past, I've had the opportunity to contribute to projects aimed at solving real-world problems using my full-stack skills. Most recently, I completed my internship focused on preventing hypoglycemic episodes in individuals with Type 1 diabetes.

        Outside of coding, Iâ€™m a huge NBA fan (go Warriors!) and love playing basketball, enjoying outdoor activities like hiking/jogging (if the weather's nice, of course), and exploring new places. This is actually my first time in Colorado, so I can't wait to see what there is to do here!
